I struck an early interest in animated movies and video games in my childhood. Since then my academic and career choices have been paved by my interest in computer graphics. The United States is a land of limitless opportunities and is the Innovation hub of the world. It is also the home to the best of gaming and animation studios such as Pixar, Disney, and Electronic Arts. I am intrigued by several interesting research projects carried out at various institutions in the USA in the field of Virtual Reality and Haptics, GPU Computing, and Rendering techniques. A World-class curriculum, best-in-class infrastructure, an intellectually-stimulating academic environment- enrolment
into this immensely reputed University, coupled with a course of my choice â€“ a combination of Computer Science and Media Technology offers the opportunity of a life-time for the
seeker and the explorer in me to hugely improve my capabilities and broad-base my knowledge frontiers. I have the passion and dedication to delve more into the world of computer graphics. My dream is to become an expert in the field of computer graphics, where I wish to develop new and improved techniques for visualizing and rendering the 3D data.
